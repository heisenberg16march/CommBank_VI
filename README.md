# Commonwealth Bank - Introduction to Data Science (Virtual Internship)

This repository contains my completed tasks from the **Introduction to Data Science** virtual internship hosted on the [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) platform in collaboration with **Commonwealth Bank**.

## 📌 Overview

As part of the virtual internship, I participated in a **job simulation** focused on the work of Commonwealth Bank’s Data Science team. The internship involved solving real-world problems using core data science and data management principles.

Through this program, I:
- Built a data engineering pipeline to process and extract insights from raw datasets.
- Applied data anonymisation techniques to ensure privacy compliance.
- Proposed innovative data analysis strategies, particularly involving social media data.
- Designed well-structured databases to support efficient data management.

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed

### 🧩 Task 1: Data Aggregation and Analysis
- Built a data engineering pipeline to aggregate data from various sources.
- Extracted valuable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

### 🔐 Task 2: Data Anonymisation
- Applied techniques to anonymize sensitive personal information in datasets.
- Ensured compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical data usage standards.

### 📊 Task 3: Propose Data Analysis Approaches
- Explored how insights can be extracted from social media data.
- Proposed effective analysis strategies to uncover patterns and trends.

### 🗃️ Task 4: Designing a Database
- Designed a relational database schema.
- Focused on clear documentation, structure, and scalability of information.
